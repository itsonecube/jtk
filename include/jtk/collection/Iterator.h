/**
 * For the sake of this documentation, when we say iterator we mean an object
 * which provides a common iterface for extracting data from a source iterator.
 * A source iterator is an object which extracts data from an underlying source
 * such as array list, doubly-linked list, etc.
 *
 * Every iterator has a lifecycle. Unlike other objects with lifecycle, an
 * iterator does not notify listeners regarding its states. An iterator is
 * created by a source iterator when the latter is created.
 *
 * When an element is requested (i.e., the next element), the iterator
 * delegates the task of extracting the element to the associated source
 * iterator. Although the source iterator may provide a direct interface
 * to extract elements, we recommend to avoid such designs.
 *
 * The iterator and the source iterator maintain a bidirectional ownership.
 * The pair is always created and destroyed together. The user is required
 * to create only the source iterator. After creation, a bidirectional ownership
 * is established. The user has to destroy either the iterator or the source
 * iterator.
 *
 * Internally, the iterator and source iterator communicate through the
 * availibility of the `m_destroy` function within the `jtk_Iterator_t`
 * structure. When the destructor of the iterator is invoked, the iterator invokes
 * the `m_destroy` function, if available. The `m_destroy` function
 * unreferences any references made to the iterator from the internal data
 * structure of the source iterator. After which, the destructor is invoked
 * against the source iterator.
 *
 * Similarly, when the destructor of the source iterator is invoked directly, the
 * reference to the `m_destroy` function pointer within the `jtk_Iterator_t`
 * structure is unreferenced before invoking the destructor against the
 * iterator.
