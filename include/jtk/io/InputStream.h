/**
 * A stream represents a sequence of bytes flowing in a particular direction,
 * that is, either as input stream or output stream. A stream is considered as
 * an output stream if you are writing bytes to the stream. Similarly, a stream
 * is considered as an input stream if you are reading bytes from the stream.
 * In either case, a stream is abstract in nature and may be associated with
 * files, sockets, strings, arrays, etc.
 *
 * The various input stream implementations support decoration pattern via
 * the chaining pattern. To understand the concepts of this pattern, assume two
 * different input stream implementations, j1 and j2. Suppose the stream j1 has
 * to be decorated by the stream j2, we require the implementation of j1 to
 * expose a raw input stream i1. This enables the stream j2 to interface the source
 * input stream to read data. Thus, multiple input stream implementations can be
 * chained and decorated.
 *
 * The `jtk_InputStream_t` structure declares function pointers that are required
 * to be "implemented" by an input stream variant.
 *
 * It should be noted that, when the head raw input stream is destroyed it
 * it triggers the destruction of the chain. The subsequent input streams in
 * the chain are destroyed recursively. Each input stream (raw and implementation)
 * is destroyed in the following order: the raw input stream is first destroyed,
 * followed by its implementation. Further, when an input stream is attached
 * to a chain, its destruction is handled by the head input stream, which has
 * to be manually deleted.
